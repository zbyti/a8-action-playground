Online documentation for ACTION! run-›time library package.››(C) 1983 Action Computer Services›All Rights Reserved.››››››The ACTION! runtime library package›consists of a number of files that›are intended to be INCLUDEd in other›ACTION! programs so that they may be›run without the ACTION! cartridge.››The file SYS.ACT contains the entire›set of ACTION! runtime routines›supported by the ACTION! cartridge.›This file may simply be INCUDEd at›the beginning of an ACTION! program›before it is compiled.  The file›SYSALL.ACT is similar to SYS.ACT but›it consists of serveral other INCLUDE›directives which make up the entire›set of runtime routines.  Listed›below is a brief description of each›INCLUDE file in SYSALL.ACT and the›routines that make up each file:››SYSLIB.ACT - This file contains the›primative runtime support routines ›plus a few declarations used by the›rest of the INCLUDE files.›   Clos - close channel›   Output - output string, no EOL›   In - input string   ›   XIOstr - do CIO call›   Opn - open file›   Prt - output string with EOL››   Error - calls DOSVEC, see OS doc.›   Break››   LShift - left shift routine›   RShift - right shift routine›   SetSign - internal PROC›   SS1 - internal PROC›   SMops - internal PROC›   MultB - internal PROC›   MultI - multiply  routine›   DivI - divide routine›   RemI - remainder (MOD) routine›   SArgs - routine to save arguments››SYSIO.ACT - IO routines.  All of›these routines assume the existence›of SYSLIB.ACT.  Names in parentheses›are other routines needed for that›routine to work.  Note that ordering›is very important and should not be›changed from that of file.›   ChkErr - internal›   Break1 - internal›   Open - (ChkErr)›   PrintE - (PrintDE)›   PrintDE - (ChkErr)›   Close - (ChkErr)›   Print - (PrintD)›   PrintE - (ChkErr)›   InS - internal›   InputS - (InputSD)›   InputSD - (InputMD)›   InputMD - (InputD)›   InputD - (InS, ChkErr)›   GetD - (CCIO)›   CCIO - internal›   PutE - (Put)›   Put - (PutD)›   PutD - (PutD1)›   PutD1 - internal›   PutDE - (PutD1)›   XIO - (ChkErr)›   CToStr - internal›   PrintB - (PrintC)›   PrintC - (CToStr, PNum)›   PNum - internal (ChkErr)›   PrintBE - (PrintCE)›   PrintCE - (PrintC, PutE)›   PrintBD - (PrintCD)›   PrintCD - (CToStr, PNum)›   PritnBDE - (PrintCDE)›   PrintCDE - (PrintCD, PutE)›   PrintI - (PrintID)›   PrintID - (PutD1, PrintCD)›   PrintIE - (PrintI, PutE)›   PrintIDE - (PrintID, PutE)›   StrB - (StrC)›   StrC - (CToStr)›   StrI - (CToStr)›   InputB - (InputC)›   InputC - (InputI)›   InputI - (InputBD)›   InputBD - (InputCD)›   InputCD - (InputID)›   InputID - (InputD, ValB)›   ValB - (ValC)›   ValC - (ValI)›   ValI›   PrintH - internal›   PrintF - (PF2)›   PF2 - internal (Put, Print,›         PrintI, PrintH, PrintC)›   Note - (ChkErr)›   Point - (ChkErr)››SYSGR.ACT - Graphics routines.  See›SYSLIB.ACT and SYSIO.ACT comments.›   Graphics - (Close, Open)›   Position - (Pos1)›   Pos1 - internal›   GrIO - internal (Pos1)›   DrawTo - (GrIO, XIO)›   Locate - (Position, GetD)›   Plot - (Pos1, PutD)›   SetColor›   Fill - (GrIO, XIO)››SYSMISC.ACT - Miscellaneous routines.›See SYSLIB.ACT.›   Rand›   Sound›   SndRst›   Paddle›   PTrig›   Stick›   STrig›   Peek - (PeekC)›   PeekC›   Poke›   PokeC - (Poke)››SYSBLK.ACT - Block memory routines.›   Zero - (SetBlock)›   SetBlock›   MoveBlock››SYSSTR.ACT - String handling routines›   SCompare›   SCopy›   SCopyS - (SCopy)›   SAssign - (SCopy)›››Please note that the trace option is›not available in the runtime package›and that it is recommended that the›system variable 'device' be set to›zero if the resulting object file is›to be used with other software that›might set this memory location ($B7)›to a nonzero value before the ACTION!›code is referenced.  If it is not›possible to use this memory location,›device can be redefined by placing›the following declaration before the›runtime library INCLUDE(s):›    BYTE device=$xx›Note that xx must be a zero-page›location.  If a zero-page location is›not available, then you will have to›use the IO routines that require you›to provide the IO channel (device).››The IO routines Clos, Output, In,›XIOstr, Opn and Prt can be referenced›in your program but there is no ›equivalent of these routines in the›cartridge library.  Clos, Output,›XIOstr and Prt are the same as Close,›PrintD, XIO and PrintDE.  Opn is the›same as Open except it is up to you›to make sure that the filespec has an›EOL at the end of it if one is needed›(for disk file names without a three›letter extension).  In is similar to›InputMD except you are responsible›for storing the maximum size in the›first byte of the string before In is›called.  NONE OF THESE ROUTINES DO›ERROR CHECKING.››NOTE that the system should be Booted›(B command in monitor) after you have›finished with the program(s) that use›the runtime package.  If you try to›run a program that does not use the›runtime package after you have›compiled a program that does use the›runtime package, there is a good ›chance that the system will crash.››
